          <p>These are the main drivers behind a huge investment activity in the industry to be propelled by the EU as part of the EU Digital Decade strategy.</p>
          <p>This It creates a raft of opportunities for edge cloud infrastructure and flexible datacentre development close to its users.</p>
          <p>The combination of  a huge uptick in power consumption in all hyperscale DC locations in Amsterdam, Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Milan with a potential growth demand for additional computing power additions, there is not enough space in the grid to cater to all these requirements. There is a wide expectation of a 6 fold rise in the next decade.</p>
          <p>Therefore, our strategy to be close to the power generation while a using direct connection line to generation with a limited utilization of the power grid saves costs and enables higher operational flexibility.</p>

              <p>Revolutionize the data center industry by building a network of interconnected, efficient, and strategically located small—to—medium-sized data centers (DCs) offering superior service and flexibility. (This is based on extensive experience and cost related to TIER 4 and big datacenters, that we do believe will become much less frequent and interesting.)</p>
              <p>Leveraging EU support, we aim to offer a robust alternative to the monopolistic hold of industry giants, with competitive advantages in efficiency, security, and regulatory compliance,</p>
