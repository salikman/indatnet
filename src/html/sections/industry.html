          <p>These are the main drivers behind a huge investment activity in the industry to be propelled by the EU as part of the EU Digital Decade strategy.</p>
          <p>This It creates a raft of opportunities for edge cloud infrastructure and flexible datacentre development close to its users.</p>
          <p>The combination of  a huge uptick in power consumption in all hyperscale DC locations in Amsterdam, Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Milan with a potential growth demand for additional computing power additions, there is not enough space in the grid to cater to all these requirements. There is a wide expectation of a 6 fold rise in the next decade.</p>
          <p>Therefore, our strategy to be close to the power generation while a using direct connection line to generation with a limited utilization of the power grid saves costs and enables higher operational flexibility.</p>

            <div class="accordion__content">
              <p>With digital transformation accelerating globally, the demand for data processing and storage is at an all-time high.</p>
              <p>Amazon.com Inc. plans to invest around $150 billion in data centers over the next 15 years to meet the surging demand for AI applications
                and digital services. This aggressive expansion aims to maintain Amazons lead in the cloud services market. The investment will focus on
                expanding current facilities and establishing new ones in various global locations, including Mississippi, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Traditional air cooling methods are becoming less effective, prompting a shift towards liquid cooling solutions. This transition is driven by
                the need for more efficient, sustainable, and reliable cooling methods, especially for high-density computing hardware like GPUs. The shift
                towards liquid cooling, despite historical reservations about water near electronics, promises lower power consumption and reduced
                water usage compared to air cooling. <strong>(We have a different cooling solution)</strong></p>
              <p>The Forbes article titled <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/26/heres-why-data-center-cooling-is-the-hottest-innovation-in-the-sector/">"Heres Why Data Center Cooling Is The Hottest Innovation In The Sector"</a> highlights the critical challenge of
                cooling in data centers, driven by the massive demand from AI, machine learning, and supercomputing. As the CEO of Aligned Data
                Centers, Andrew Schaap, points out, data centers are essential to the digital world, powering everything from scientific research to
                everyday appliances like smart fridges. However, they also generate significant heat.</p>
              <p>The traditional cooling methods, mostly air-based, are becoming less effective and sustainable, given the bulky infrastructure and high
                energy and water usage. This has led to an urgent need for more efficient cooling solutions, especially as data center power
                consumption in the U.S. is projected to double between 2022 and 2030</p>

            <div class="accordion__content">
              <p><q>A shift towards efficiency and decentralization is not just anticipated its already happening. 
                Our extensive market research underlines a clear trend: the future of datacenters lies in their ability to be both more
                effective and more sustainable. This presents a golden opportunity for forward-thinking investors.</q></p>
              <h4>Why Now is the Opportune Moment</h4>
              <p>The datacenter sector is at a pivotal juncture, with demands for efficiency and sustainability driving significant change. Were positioned
                at the forefront of this transition, offering a solution that addresses these needs head-on. Our innovation doesnt just promise; it delivers.
                With a focus on achieving a low Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), our data centers stand out for their reduced operational costs and
                substantial alignment with global sustainability objectives.</p>
              <h4>The Competitive Edge: Efficiency and Sustainability</h4>
              <p>PUE, a critical measure of a datacenters efficiency, is a cornerstone of our offering. A lower PUE signifies a more efficient datacenter,
                leading to lower operational costs and a lesser environmental impact. Our data centers achieve an unparalleled PUE of 1.1, setting a new
                benchmark in the industry. To put this into perspective, the best PUEs globally hover around 1.1 to 1.2, with anything below 1.5 considered
                highly efficient. This isnt a concept in development its a reality weve already achieved. Our solution not only meets but exceeds the
                future trends of datacenter efficiency.</p>
